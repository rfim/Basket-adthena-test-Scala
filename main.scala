/* Welcome to the Scala Playground!
 *
 * This repl utilizes the `sbtn` thin client.
 *
 * To increase compilation speed, it's recommended to
 * start `sbt` in a Shell tab before clicking "Run".
 *
 * This will use a single instance of sbt for all
 * compilation, instead of launching sbt every time.
